        <blockquote><p style="color: black; font-size: 14px; font-family: Consolas; line-height: 24px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>Just 20 years ago, Martin Angelo M. Ortega came in this world as a second-born child in his family. <sup>2</sup>He grew up in
             the province of Morong, Rizal where 90% of his heart belongs to. <sup>3</sup>For him, growing up in a small province is one of the nicest things a child will ever experience. <sup>4</sup>He would go to the market 
             with his mom or sometimes with his grandmother, every sunday. <sup>5</sup>Whenever they go off to somewhere they would always come across with someone they know, either their classmate, friend, or your teacher, it is because
              the province is just small so you will often meet someone you know in the bakery while buying malunggay flavored pandesal.<sup>6</sup>Growing up, he also experienced playing with his friends along the street, they would go out in the afternoon to play marbles,
           <i>teks</i>, <i>tilador</i>, <i>hampasan ng tsinelas</i>, <i>duraan</i>, and <i>asaran ng nanay.</i> <sup>7</sup>Martin is not an honor student, he never got an award in their class, only the <i>mabuting bata</i> award,
            because he returned a missing 20 pesos bill to the school guidance. <sup>8</sup>His parents does not push him to be an honor student, so he became a consistent lazy student instead. <sup>9</sup>One of his childhood fears is
            the fear of spiders. <sup>10</sup>He always remember when his classmate brought a spider in school, the spider ran towards his arm and ended up stepping on the spider out of panic. <sup>11</sup>One of his favorite family bonding
            during his childhood is when they go out to watch cinema almost every month. <sup>12</sup>They would also go to his grandparents' house in Cubao during Christmas vacation and summer. <sup>13</sup>During the Christmas vacation
            they would go to Araneta center to see the giant Christmas tree and watch the fireworks at night. <sup>14</sup>Sometimes, they go to La Union for vacation along with their other relatives. <sup>15</sup>His grandmother owns a house
            at Bauang, La Union, which gives them the chance to stay their for like a week. <sup>16</sup>The house is just minutes away from the beach so they often go to the beach in the morning and afternoon to relax and have fun. <sup>17</sup>
            They would buy freshly catched fish from the fishermen and grill it for their lunch. <sup>18</sup>Collecting shells at the beach is Martin's favorite thing to do, he would fill up a plastic cup with shells and then throw it back at the sea
            before they go home. <sup>19</sup>During his childhood days, he does not actually care about everything, he just enjoys everything just like what young kids do. <sup>20</sup> For him, childhood days is the happiest phase of life, because
            as a child the only problem you would have is how you will explain to your mother that you lost her tupperware or foldable umbrella.</p></blockquote></div>

                he actually learned everything he know today. <sup>3</sup>During these years, he met a lot of people, made a lot of friends, learned new things, experienced new things for the first time, and all. <sup>4</sup>He went to 4 different schools from pre-school to senior high school. 
                <sup>5</sup>Because of that, he met a lot of people from different schools making him confident and comfortable around them. <sup>6</sup>Getting more and more comfortable with the people, he discovered that he is good at throwing jokes in the class. 
                <sup>7</sup>Even if the joke is not actually funny, Martin still manages to make his classmates laugh so hard because of the way he delivers the joke in front of them. <sup>8</sup> His personality really helped him to gain more friends during those times. <sup>9</sup>Being a jolly and 
                very humorous person, is not that easy for him, because when there are times that he needs to be serious he laughs easily even on the slightest things. <sup>10</sup>He was in grade 7 when his classmates and teachers noticed that he has a good penmanship. <sup>11</sup>Even his new 
                classmates in Grade 11 notices his good handwriting. <sup>12</sup>His adviser would borrow his notebook and show it to teachers in the faculty bragging about his student's (Martin) good handwriting. <sup>13</sup>His classmates would also ask him if he is gay because of his handwriting.
                <sup>14</sup>This is the phase of his life where he discovered new things about his self. <sup>15</sup>He discovered that he has fear of frogs during their biology activity which is dissecting of frogs when an alive frog jump off his arm. <sup>16</sup>Martin remembers so many memories
                during those times because it is when he experienced new things for the first time. <sup>17</sup>One of his greatest memory during those times is when he and his classmates went to General Nakar, Quezon Province for their project Lakbay Sanaysay. <sup>18</sup>It was his first time 
                going out for an overnight trip with his classmates. <sup>19</sup>Another memory that he will never forget is their bonding every after class, they would go to a classmate's house, cook anything they want and eat together while listening to music. <sup>20</sup>For him, those were the 
                times that he will forever cherish. <sup>21</sup>Martin's teenage years was not always full of joy, he also went into deep sadness when he lost important people in his life. <sup>22</sup>For him, this is the phase of his life that he will cherish the most, he would always wish that he 
                can go back to those days to make more memories with his friends.</p></blockquote>

                <sup>3</sup>Although he was not really interested in taking up BSIT in the first place, you would still see his determination and effort. <sup>4</sup>He was really into Civil Engineering since he is good in Math but unfortunately he did not pass the entrance exams in <abbr title="University of the Philippines">UP</abbr> and <abbr title="Polytechnic University of the Philippines">PUP</abbr>.
                <sup>5</sup>He wanted to take up Civil Engineering in <abbr title="University of the Philippines">UP</abbr> and <abbr title="Polytechnic University of the Philippines">PUP</abbr> because the board exam passing rate in those two universities is high. <sup>6</sup>University of the East was his family's last resort, 
                he took BSIT because it is one of those in demand courses right now, and since his father is a Professional Software Developer, he was encouranged to take up BSIT. <sup>7</sup>At first, he has no idea what the course will be all about, considering the fact that he was enrolled in STEM strand during Senior Highschool. 
                <sup>8</sup>Everything can be learned if you choose to learn,  so he is slowly getting interested in his course specifically in programming because of his determination and of course because of his good professors. <sup>9</sup>He felt proud and happy when he completed and solved a programming problem for the first time. 
                <sup>10</sup>He also made a lot of friends in college, he found the perfect people with the same level of humour as him. <sup>11</sup>They would study together before the exams. <sup>12</sup>Their main bonding is playing valorant during their free time. <sup>13</sup>It will not be that hard to be close to them if you 
                can reach the level of their humour. <sup>14</sup>A day will not pass without them having a stomach ache out of laughter. <sup>15</sup>Even though the class is being held virtually, you would still see how strong their bond is, as if they know each other for decades. <sup>16</sup>Martin is always thankful because he will not get the chance to
                meet his classmates. <sup>17</sup>There were no regrets at all when he enrolled in BSIT because everything turned out great. <sup>18</sup>For him, this is one of the stage of life that needs to be taken seriously, since the next stage after college is entering the corporate world. <sup>19</sup>He also wanted
                his college life to be memorable as possible. <sup>20</sup>As of now, he is still in the process of learning new things in programming to become successful in the future.</p></blockquote>
